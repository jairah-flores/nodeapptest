This is a simple NodeJS Application. Below are the breakdown of each component:

- package.json: Package of the node.js application. In this project, the Express framework is used. This also lists the dependencies used in building the application.
- index.js: Entrypoint of the web application that sends the response depending on the URL path we configured.
- package-lock.json: A file created automatically by NPM when we build and install packages on the project. It manages dependencies and ensures that the same versions of packages are installed consistently across different environments.
- Dockerfile: The file that contains instructions to build a docker image. In this project, we are building from node:latest container image.
- deploymentservice.yml: A Deployment kubernetes resource file that manages the creation and scaling of ReplicaSets, which in turn manage the lifecycle of Pods. 
                         A Service provides a stable endpoint for accessing the application and exposes it to our localhost.
                         In this project, we defined the deployment and service in a single file for simplified management and one-step deployment.
